		<h1>Ciao</h1>
		<p>My name is Gianluca Casati. I am an italian mathematician, working as an IT Consultant since 2005. I ❤ coding and open source! I feel a strong passion for mathematics. I enjoy playing guitar and percussions.</p>
		<h1>Contacts</h1>
		<p>You joined many social networks, and I have a profile on many sites. I like to increase my online presence.</p>
		<p>Yes, I have a <a href="">Facebook profile</a> that let me meet again my friends in Chile after 15 years (thank you, Andrès Hernaiz, to find me on the Internet).</p>
		<p>I also have <a href="">Twitter</a> but  do not use it often, by now.<p>
		<p>I am addicted to Hacker News and I have more than 200 karma points at the time of this writing, on my <a href="">HN profile</a>.</p>
		<p>Talking of my addictions, I joined GitHub (thanks to the mythic Ingy döt Net), and I put there almost all the code I write, including this site which is also hosted on GitHub Pages. I am convinced that GitHub behaviour and ethic is the key for the evolution of mankind in this new millenium. My nick on GitHub is <a href="">fibo</a> that stands for Leonardo Pisano (a.k.a. Fibonacci, the son of Bonacci), which was the main mathematician of the middle age.</p>
		<p>Fibonacci is famous for its sequence, but, he didn't really care about it: it was just one of the many excercises in its book <em>Liber Abaci</em>. There are many math formulas waiting to be discovered or rediscovered, think about Euler for example: most of the works written by the most prolific mathematician are still unpublished, just waiting.</p>
