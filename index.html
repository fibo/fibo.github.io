  <h2>Contacts</h2>
    <p>I joined many social networks, and I have a profile on many sites. I like to increase my online presence.</p>
  <h3>Facebook</h3>
    <p>Yes, I have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gianluca.casati.7" title="Facebook" rel="me">Facebook profile</a> that let me met again my friends in Chile after 15 years (thank you, Andrès Hernaiz, to find me on the Internet).</p>
  <h3>Twitter</h3>
    <p>I also have <a href="https://twitter.com/GianlucaCasati" title="Twitter" rel="me">Twitter</a>: I do not use it often, by now.<p>
  <h3>Google</h3>
  <p>I love Google services: you can find me on <a href="https://plus.google.com/+GianlucaCasati" title="Google+" rel="me">Google+</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gianlucacasati" title="YouTube" rel="me">YouTube</a>.<p>
  <h3>Hacker news</h3>
    <p>I am addicted to Hacker News and I have more than 200 karma points at the time of this writing, on my <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fibo">HN profile</a>.</p>
  <h3>GitHub</h3>
  <p>Talking of my addictions, I joined GitHub (thanks to the mythic <a href="http://ingy.net">Ingy döt Net</a>), and I put there almost all the code I write, including this site which is also hosted on GitHub Pages. I am convinced that GitHub behaviour and ethic is the key for the evolution of mankind in this new millenium. <a href="https://github.com/thank-you-github/thank-you-github/pull/419">Thank you GitHub!</a></p>
  <p>My nick on GitHub is <a href="https://github.com/fibo" title="GitHub" rel="me">fibo</a> that stands for Leonardo Pisano (a.k.a. Fibonacci, the son of Bonacci), which was the main mathematician of the middle age. I have <img src="/svg/github/followers/fibo.svg" alt="GitHub followers"></p>
  <h3>vvvv</h3>
    <p>Fibonacci is famous for its sequence, but, he didn't really care about it: it was just one of the many excercises in its book <em>Liber Abaci</em>. There are many math formulas waiting to be discovered or rediscovered, think about Euler for example: most of the works written by the most prolific mathematician are still unpublished, just waiting. I really enjoy keep studying mathematics and implement it with a programming language, for example I produced a vvvv contribution that let artists play with Chaos Theory formulas: it is called <a href="http://vvvv.org/contribution/chaostoys">Chaos Toys</a>. I really like vvvv as an environment to play with mathematics, and it is very exciting for me thinking about artists that experiment with math formulas I implemented with vvvv. It is a fun way of doing math research, to free the formulas from the books and release them in some artistic installation that can push forward its conception to a level that even the original author could not imagine. This is my <a href="http://vvvv.org/users/fibo" title="VVVV" rel="me">vvvv profile page</a>. I am glad that vvvv users call me <em>fibo</em> on line and on site.</p>
  <h3>Linux counter</h3>
    <p>I am proud to be a registered Linux user since 2007-07-11 with count number #449643.

  <h3>Linkedin</h3>
    <p>This is my <a href="https://it.linkedin.com/in/gianlucacasati" title="Linkedin" rel="me">Linkedin profile</a>, and I would like to share also a nice story about Linkedin. As an experiment, I created the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=4743207">vvvv users group</a> hoping it can help hiring vvvv developers. The group was created just after node13 event, on November 2013 and at the time of this writing has more than 200 users.</p>
