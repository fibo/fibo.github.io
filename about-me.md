Hi! My name is Gianluca Casati.

I am an italian mathematician, working as an IT Consultant since 2005 in the Business Intelligence and Web Analytics area.

I am interested in IT also in my spare time.

I like open source and software engeneering.

I feel a really strong passion for mathematics, which I continue to study and apply to IT.

I love traveling and socialize with every kind of person.

I compose songs and I enjoy playing guitar and percussions.

*g14n* was my first nickname, it stands for Gian
