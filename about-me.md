Hi! My name is {{ site.data.package.author }}.

I am an Italian mathematician, working as an IT Consultant since 2005 in the Business Intelligence and Web Analytics area. Since 2014 I started working on Campaign Management projects too.

I am interested in IT also in my spare time.

I like open source and software engineering.

I feel a really strong passion for mathematics, which I continue to study and apply to IT.

I love traveling and socialize with every kind of person.

I compose songs and enjoy playing guitar and percussions.

*g14n* was my first nickname, it stands for Gian.
