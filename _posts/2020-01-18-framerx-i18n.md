    How to setup Framer X to integrate with i18n and add design with translations integrated
---

## Introduction

I am learning how to use [Framer X](https://www.framer.com), and as a React coder I know I need soon or later to face with [Internazionalization and localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) (a.k.a. **i18n**).
Furthermore it happens often that a mockup design can break when you switch to another language. Think for example to a *SignUp* button, that in another language could be larger and maybe breadk the layout, for example in italian is *Registrati*.

It would be great if I could have a component in *Framer X* with a *locale* dropdown where I can choose for example *English* or *Italiano* or *Espa√±ol* or any other language my product wants to target. This is what we are going to achieve in this article!

When you scout for solutions to achieve *i18n* with *React* usually you arrive to [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) or [react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl). Both are valid candidates. I am going to use the latter, but prolly arranging the following instructions you could achieve the same result with both.

## Create project

Open *Framer X*, create a new project and save it as a *folder-backed project*. You need to choose as *File Format* the option **Framer X (Folder)**.

I also uploaded example code on GitHub, this is the final result: [fibo/1i8n-example.framerfx](https://github.com/fibo/1i8n-example.framerfx).

Create a *code/i18n/* folder that will contain our translations.

In a *real word project* I created a separated package with my translations and installed it as a dependency, on `postinstall` all files are copied into *code/i18n* folder. Take a look if you want at my [go-seven/design.framerfx](https://github.com/go-seven/design.framerfx) project. Nevertheless if you want to try *i18n* integration, just create by hand the following JSON files:

*code/i18n/en.json*

```json
{
  "locale": "en",
  "messages": {
    "Pepperoni": "Pepperoni"
  }
}
```

*code/i18n/it.json*

```json
{
  "locale": "it",
  "messages": {
    "Pepperoni": "Salame Piccante"
  }
}
```

By the way, in italian *Peperone* means *Sweet pepper*, not *Salame*. It has also only one *p*, we put double letters everywhere in Italy but not in *Peperone*. This translation is a mistery, nobody knows what happened.
