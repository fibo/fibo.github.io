    How to setup Framer X to use a i18n React tool and design with translations integrated
---

## Introduction

I am learning how to use [Framer X](https://www.framer.com), and as a React coder I know I need soon or later to face with [Internazionalization and localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) (a.k.a. **i18n**).
Furthermore it happens often that a mockup design can break when you switch to another language. Think for example to a *SignUp* button, that in another language could be larger and maybe breadk the layout, for example in italian is *Registrati*.

It would be great if I could have a component in *Framer X* with a *locale* dropdown where I can choose for example *English* or *Italiano* or *EspaÃ±ol* or any other language my product wants to target. This is what we are going to achieve in this article!

When you scout for solutions to achieve *i18n* with *React* usually you arrive to [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) or [react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl). Both are valid candidates. I am going to use the latter, but prolly arranging the following instructions you could achieve the same result with both.

## Create project

Open *Framer X*, create a new project and save it as a *folder-backed project*. You need to choose as *File Format* the option **Framer X (Folder)**.

I also uploaded example code on GitHub, this is the final result: [fibo/1i8n-example.framerfx](https://github.com/fibo/1i8n-example.framerfx).

Install *i18n* library, for instance

```bash
yarn add react-intl
```

Create a *code/i18n/* folder that will contain our translations.

In a *real word project* I created a separated package with my translations and installed it as a dependency, on `postinstall` all files are copied into *code/i18n* folder. Take a look if you want at my [go-seven/design.framerfx](https://github.com/go-seven/design.framerfx) project. Nevertheless if you want to try *i18n* integration, just create by hand the following JSON files:

*code/i18n/en.json*

```json
{
  "locale": "en",
  "messages": {
    "Pepperoni": "Pepperoni"
  }
}
```

*code/i18n/it.json*

```json
{
  "locale": "it",
  "messages": {
    "Pepperoni": "Salame Piccante"
  }
}
```

By the way, in italian *Peperone* means *Sweet pepper*, not *Salame*. It has also only one *p*, we put double letters everywhere in Italy but not in *Peperone*. This translation is a mistery, nobody knows what happened... LOL ðŸ˜‚.

## Create a component

In order to have a dropdown with a selectable translation, and also due to other reasons, I found more comfortable creating a *code/components* folder with all my components and a wrapper that wiil use `addPropertyControls` provided by *framer* package to select a *locale* provided by *react-intl*. Furthermore it is also needed to use a React `ErrorBoundary`, since our component will try to access the *React Context* provided by *react-intl* which will not be available if not wrapped. In particular this will happen when the component is dragged into *Framer X* canvas.

Let's start creating a generic *ErrorBoundary* that will show a *message* if some error happens.

```js
// File: code/components/ErrorBoundaryText.tsx
import { Frame } from "framer"
import * as React from "react"

interface ErrorBoundaryTextProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
  message: String
}

export default class ErrorBoundaryText extends React.Component<ErrorBoundaryTextProps> {
  state = { hasError: false }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    return { hasError: true }
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return <Frame>{this.props.message}</Frame>
    }

    return this.props.children
  }
}
```

Now let's create a dummy component that will display a translated message.

```js
// File: code/components/MyComponent.tsx
import * as React from "react"
import { useIntl } from "react-intl"

import ErrorBoundaryText from "./ErrorBoundaryText"

export function MyComponent(props) {
  const intl = useIntl()

  return (
    <ErrorBoundaryText message="My Component">
      <Frame style={{ fontSize: 32 }}>
        {intl.formatMessage({ id: "Pepperoni" })}
      </Frame>
    </ErrorBoundaryText>
  )
}
```

Now let's create a wrapper that provides an i18n *React Context*, for several reasons I am creating those wrappers in the *code/* folder and their name start with an underscore.

```js
// File code/_IntlProvider.tsx
import * as React from "react"
import { addPropertyControls, ControlType, Frame } from "framer"
import { IntlProvider } from "react-intl"

import { MyComponent } from "./components/MyComponent"

import * as en from "./i18n/en.json"
import * as it from "./i18n/it.json"

const defaultLocale = "en"

const config = {
  en,
  it
}

export function _IntlProvider(props) {
  const { locale } = props
  const localeConfig = config[locale]

  return (
    <IntlProvider
      defaultLocale={defaultLocale}
      {...localeConfig}
    >
      <MyComponent />
    </IntlProvider>
  )
}

_IntlProvider.defaultProps = {
  locale: defaultLocale,
}

addPropertyControls(_IntlProvider, {
  locale: {
    title: "Locale",
    type: ControlType.Enum,
    defaultValue: _IntlProvider.defaultProps.locale,
    options: ["en", "it"],
    optionTitles: ["English", "Italiano"],
  },
})
```

And you are done! This is a what you will see

## Conclusion

For sure you will need a richer structure but the good new is that it is possible to use *Framer X* with *i18n* and I am sure this could add a lot of value to a development workflow.

Keep in mind that I started using *Framer X* recently and this is a first experiment, this process can improved a lot but it is for sure a promising starting point.
