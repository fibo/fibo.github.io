    How to setup Framer X to integrate with i18n and add design with translations integrated
---

## Introduction

I am learning how to use [Framer X](https://www.framer.com), and as a React coder I know I need soon or later to face with [Internazionalization and localization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization).
Furthermore it happens often that a mockup design can break when you switch to another language. Think for example to a *SignUp* button, that in another language could be larger and maybe breadk the layout, for example in italian is *Registrati*.

It would be great if I could have a component in *Framer X* with a *locale* dropdown where I can choose for example *English* or *Italiano* or *Espa√±ol* or any other language my product wants to target. This is what we are going to achieve in this article!
