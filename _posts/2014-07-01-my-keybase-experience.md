## Me at Keybase

Hi! This is [me at Keybase][2].

> Keybase will be a public directory of publicly auditable public keys. All paired, for convenience, with unique usernames.

I've just signed up to [Keybase][1] *alpha* last 12th of June thanks to a private invitation. Thank you, Max & Chris!

I like [Keybase][1], 'cause:

* It is a pretty good way to getting started [Pretty Good Privacy][3]
* It is a service accessible to everyone, you don't need to manage your own server.
* It is open source, see [Keybase organization on GitHub][4].
* It has a [Node][5] client, I like it!

## My identity

First of all, I created a [public OpenPGP key][6].
Then I veryfied my GitHub identity with this [gist proof][7].
That's all by now, I will annotate here everything I will discover about this new world.
