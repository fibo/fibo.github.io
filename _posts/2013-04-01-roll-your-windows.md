Right click a window title bar rolls it.

Middle click makes them translucent.

And *WOW* it is written in **Assembly**!

A lovely example of opensource and freeware.

It works fine on Windows 8 too, I just installed it.

[Download WinRoll from here](http://www.palma.com.au/winroll/).

Thank you *Wil Palma* for sharing your elite skills.
