    When I started using the fish-shell and entered in a nice community
---

Yesterday I tryed the [fish-shell][1].

Well, in the morning I noticed that the Homepage was broken so I [opened an issue](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-site/issues/32) and I got a really quick response.
I thought the following:

> there is one big internet community

where people help each other, infact I can get a great piece of software and contribute back with a pr, opening an issue or whatever.

The community around [fish-shell][1] is part of that *big community*.
In the evening I was also contacted by [bucaran](http://bucaran.me) who is the author of many quality software projects, in particular [fisherman](http://fisherman.sh/).

So, I was really stimulated from the first day and most of all: [fish-shell][1] looks great.

I tryed it on Linux and Mac OSX.
