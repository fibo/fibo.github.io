[VVVV][1] is a hybrid graphical/textual programming environment for easy prototyping and development.

There are other interaction design softwares, but that is the point! VVVV is not only a software, it is a programming language so you can write your own modules, shaders, plugins, and even more.

There is a awesome community using VVVV. I knew devvvvs and visited [Meso][2], as well as many VVVV users: everyone is really kind.

Using VVVV you can interface with devices, like

* Kinect
* Arduino
* Leap Motion
* DMX

Using VVVV you can interoparate with other software like

* [Pure Data][3]
* [Max][4]
* Reaktor

### VVVV for math

I think that for a mathematician VVVV is the greatest software to use, cause an *everything ready* software like Wolfram Mathematica is not a research tool. A real mathematician likes to experiment and to understand deepily what he is studying.
