<div class="paper warning">This article was written 9 months before official Perl6 release on XMas 2015. It contains instructions about how to build it from sources but you may want to use a tool like <a href="https://github.com/tadzik/rakudobrew">rakudobrew</a> to manage Perl6 installations.</div>

I read the [announce of Rakudo Star][1] as a

> a useful and usable distribution of Perl 6

so let's try it.

## Install

Create a folder for your brand new Perl6.

```bash
export PERL6_BASE=$HOME/perl6
mkdir $PERL6_BASE
```

Do not use any `~` in the `PERL6_BASE` value, cause is not expanded by *MoarVM* Configule.pl script.

You need Perl and few CPAN modules.

```
cpan autodie
```

Get and build [MoarVM][2]

```
cd /tmp
wget http://moarvm.com/releases/MoarVM-2015.03.tar.gz
tar xf MoarVM-2015.03.tar.gz
cd MoarVM-2015.03
perl Configure.pl --prefix=$HOME/perl6
make install
```

So far so good, let's install [Rakudo][3]

```
cd /tmp
wget http://rakudo.org/downloads/star/rakudo-star-2015.03.tar.gz
tar xf rakudo-star-2015.03.tar.gz
cd rakudo-star-2015.03
perl Configure.pl --backend=moar --prefix=$PERL6_BASE --gen-moar
make
make rakudo-test
make install
```

## Hello Perl6

Ok, let's say *Hello World* with Perl6.

Add *perl6* to your PATH

```
export PATH=$PERL6_BASE/bin:$PATH
```

Create a file Hello.pl6 containing

```
say "Hello World"
```

and run it

```
perl6 Hello.pl6
```

Yes I know, it looks like Perl5, but now we can play with Perl6. Happy coding!
