     Is it worth to run a Bitcoin node? Is it better to use a local Raspberry Pi or a cloud EC2 instance?

My goal is to learn how to use [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/).

I have evaluated running it on a Raspberry Pi but then I decided to go for a cloud EC2 instance.
I have just ordered a Raspberry, it will arrive next Monday and the total order amount for the Raspberry 5, an original charger and an original case is around 129â‚¬. I will probably enjoy playing with the Raspberry but for now it looks a smarter option to me to learn running *Bitcoin Core* on a Linux server in the cloud. According to the minimum requirements (in particular, 1GB of RAM) taking advantage of the *AWS Saving Plan* I could run the node for almost 3 years for the same price I spent for the Raspberry.

Anyway... my goal is to learn, will write here my progress, tips and I hope it helps others.
