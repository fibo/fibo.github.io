Hey, you can edit this post [here](https://github.com/fibo/fibo.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2015-09-23-perl-xor-javascript.md), I am sure many other analogies between Perl and JavaScript can be added to this list.

## use strict

Both are mot strict by default, by the way the syntax to turn on *strict mode* is exactly the same.

| Perl        | JavaScript    |
|-------------|---------------|
|`use strict;`|`"use strict;"`|

## Ubiquitous

Perl is everywhere server side, JavaScript is everywhere client side.

## Version 6

Both had their popular version 5 with an amazing version 6.

## Data structures

Syntax for arrays and objects is the same.

```
[] {}
```

and now with ES6 also JavaScript has *trailing commas*, I mean

```
{
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,  // <-- comma allowed here, finally I can use ddkp vim command to swap lines (:
}
```


## Misc

Perl vs JavaScript both misunderstood or underestimated by masses.

Perl has a symbol table, now with ES6 also JavaScript has Symbol (this is just coincidence).

Handcrafted Object oriented system.

â€¦ more stuff will be added.
