     Mac Terminal is the Non Plus Ultra. Let me share my configuration, in particular I want to remember that font! R.I.P. Steve.

Ok, let me get this straight: I use the *Pro* terminal profile. I always loved transparency effect in terminals.

Then I want a nice monospace font, possibly with ligatures. Go for [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) by [tonsky](https://tonsky.me).
Font size, of course, is up to you: mine is *14 pt*. Turn on *Antialias text*.

Another default configuration that I suggest to change is:

* When the shell exits
  - [x] Close if the shell exited cleanly.

I often use <kbd>CTRL</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> to close the shell, and I mean it so no confirmation is required.
