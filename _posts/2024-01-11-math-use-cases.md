One of the main questions I got when I started stydying Mathematics at the *UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova* from people was:

> I do not like numbers in general, and why is Mathematics useful? Which are the applications?

And usually I answered something like:

> There are so many. For example the mobile phone you are holding now is using a [Fourier transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) to decode your voice into a sequence of 0 and 1 and send it to the other side of the call.

There is a huge topic where Mathematics is changing (again) the world we live: privacy and cryptography.

I am writing this article mainly because I want to share the [Cypherpunk manifesto](/misc/cypherpunk-manifesto.html).

I never imagined when I was studying [Elliplic curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve) at my third year of University that they would become so important!
