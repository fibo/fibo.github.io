    About installing Perl in hostile environments.

## Motivation

Right now I'm working on a Centos 6 Linux box. I have no *cpan* client

```
$ cpan
-bash: cpan: command not found
```

and a deprecated version of Perl :(

```
$ perl -v

This is perl, v5.10.1 ...
```

What is worse is that I will deploy on a host with no Internet access, probably with no root permissions ... but there is a hope

## Bootstrap

### Requirements

You need to install [ExtUtils::MakeMaker][1].

If you get errors like

```
Can't locate ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm in @INC
```

probabily is not installed. That is a silly choice of some Linux distros, yes I said **silly** cause [ExtUtils::MakeMaker][1] is a core module and it should be provided with any Perl distribution.

Get root permissions and install it, on Centos just launch

```bash
$ yum install perl-ExtUtils-MakeMaker
```

If you can't do it, go straight and compile your own Perl: see [dotsoftware](//{{ site.domain }}/dotsoftware).

### Choose your target

Create a folder that will be your Perl home. To make it easier, I choose [local::lib][2] default

```bash
$ export PERL_BASE=~/perl5
```

### Get cpanm

As documented in [App::cpanminus related section]( https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus#Downloading-the-standalone-executable), get a standalone *cpanm* executable to bootstrap your Perl.

```bash
$ mkdir -p $PERL_BASE/bin
$ cd $PERL_BASE/bin
$ curl -LO http://xrl.us/cpanm
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  262k  100  262k    0     0   279k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  279k
$ chmod +x cpanm
```

### Install local::lib

Now you can install [local::lib][2] locally

```bash
$ ./cpanm -l $PERL_BASE local::lib
```

Load special environment variables. Note that *~/.perl_profile* file will be overwritten.

```bash
$ cd $PERL_BASE/lib/perl5
$ perl -Mlocal::lib=$PERL_BASE > ~/.perl_profile
$ source ~/.perl_profile
```

Make it permanent, edit your profile. For example you can launch

```bash
$ grep 'source ~/.perl_profile' ~/.bash_profile || echo 'source ~/.perl_profile' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

which will add `source ~/.perl_profile` to your *.bash_profile* only once.

### Try it

At this point you have your system Perl with a *cpanm* that can install locally

Give it a try it, install [Perl::Tidy][5]


```bash
$ cpanm Perl::Tidy
   Working on Perl::Tidy
Fetching http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/S/SH/SHANCOCK/Perl-Tidy-20140328.tar.gz ... OK

Building and testing Perl-Tidy-20140328 ... OK
Successfully installed Perl-Tidy-20140328
1 distribution installed
$ which perltidy
~/perl5/bin/perltidy
```

### Get CPAN

Now you can choose, to keep *cpanm* or get the official CPAN client

```bash
$ cpanm CPAN
```

Then maybe you want [A CPAN client that works like a charm][4].
