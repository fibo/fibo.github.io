    Which is better? axios or fetch? Let me share my ( unconventional, as always :^) opinion.
---

## Motivation

There are few articles comparing *fetch* vs *axios*, and saying that axios is better... but when you read them, the pros are not so compelling in my opinion.
The main point is that *axios* has better error handling, and that it returns JSON with no extra effort.
On the other hand, the fact that *fetch* is already there, and [you can use it](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch) **natively** is a **huge win**.
I found that *fetch* is more generic and I trust that the smart people that is building the web [did the right thing](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/Right-Thing.html).

The good new is that

> Few lines of code are needed to implement axios features, using fetch.

## Show me the code

Suppose you want to launch an API request, on some `url`, authenticated by
a JWT `token`.

```javascript
// It is supposed that variables `url` and `token` are given.
fetch(`${url}`, {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Accept': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `BEARER ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
}).then(res => res.ok ? res.json() : new Error(res.statusText))
  .then(data => { console.log(data) })
  .catch(err => { throw err })
```

Note that this function checks response status and returns a Promise with data argument in JSON format.

```javascript
res => res.ok ? res.json() : new Error(res.statusText)
```
