---

## Goal

I have two user emails created on my *Google Workspace*, for example *bob@my-company.com* and *alice@my-company.com*. Both are in the *administration@my-company.com* group. We are going to achieve that they can recieve and reply to emails as *administration@my-company.com*

## Instructions

Login to [Admin console](https://admin.google.com). Go to *Groups* and create a group email, for example, *Administration* with email *administration@my-company.com*, then add the users.

In order to be able to recieve emails from outside, for example when you register on a website, make sure to check the *External* flag in the **Publish posts** row.

Then every member need to configure his/her settings to enable **send mail as** feature.

![Add another email](/images{{ page.id }}/gmail-add-another-email.png)

In the confirmation box (the yellow one) make sure that *Treat as an alias* is **NOT** checked.

Go ahead and complete with email confirmation code as required.

Once completed you will be able with your *user email* not only to recieve emails sent to the *group email* but also to reply them. During email composition, just click on the dropdown icon to choose a group email address.
