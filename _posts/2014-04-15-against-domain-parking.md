I **hate** [domain parking][1] with monetization purpouse!

I wanted to register [todo.es][2] domain to use it as a website for a lab of design: it is a dream I have.

As you can see, [todo.es][2] points to an empty page, with some ads: nobody is using it.

I discovered it is owned by a company named [Sedo][3].

I registered on [Sedo][3] and make my offer. Despite *todo.es* is not used I cannot buy it, cause it is ... mmh **parked**.

So, I made my offer, starting from the lower price allowed by [Sedo][3], that is 60€.

This was their answer:

> The other party has made the following comment with this offer: i think you must search for another domain in another tld, because i won´t sell this domain for less than <strong>10000€</strong>.

<p class="well text-danger text-center">What an evil behaviour!</p>

I think it is not ethic to *park* domains. I ask to the reader, if you can do something to prevent or avoid this practice, or you know something I could do, some petition or whatever, please let me know.

I know that in the real world there are so many bad things happening, but please, at least on Internet, do not do that!
