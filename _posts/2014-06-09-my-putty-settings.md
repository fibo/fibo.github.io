## Get Putty

[Putty][1] is a free (MIT-licensed) Win32 Telnet and SSH client. You need it if you want to use a terminal on Windows, I mean a **real** terminal, *MS/DOS* is not decent.

Check also [PuttyTray](https://puttytray.goeswhere.com/), it adds nice features like *Always on Top* and *Window transparency*

## Regedit

For the impatient: copy the following content in a *.reg* file. To import it in *regedit*, right click on it and choose *merge* on the contextual menu.

It will overwrite the *Default Settings* configuration, details are in [Configuration summary](#configuration-summary).

```

## Configuration summary

### Window

#### Appearance

Use a [monospaced font](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font), for instance *Consolas* with 12 point size.

Choose *ClearType* as font quality.

Check the *Hide mouse pointer when typing window* flag.

#### Behaviour

Check the *Full screen on Alt-Enter* flag.

#### Translation

Choose *UTF-8* encoding.

#### Colours

[Putty][1] default colours are not the best choice. Since folders are *blue* on a *black* background, the output of a simple `ls` is really hard to see.

The fastest workaround is to flag *Use system colours*.

You will joy a better color theme, for example the *eighties* theme from [base16-vim]( https://github.com/benjojo/base-16-putty).

### Connection

#### Data

Flag *Use system username* in the *When username is not specified* combo box.

#### SSH

##### X11

Flag the *Enable X11 forwarding* option if you want to launch graphic programs.

Install some X Server for Windows. For example you can use [XMing](http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/): you need to donate to download the *Website release*. I used an [older release on SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/): I flagged the *Don't install an SSH client* installer option.

Then start XMing and connect with PuTTY to the remote server: now you can launch any graphic application, try with *Xeyes*.

## Tips

### Automate login

It is not considered really secure, but, if you are not paranoic this is a really good tip.

Create a shortcut to Putty, you know, right click on it an send to Desktop. Then right click the shortcut and edit the *Target* entry adding `-pw` and `-ssh` flags with *user* and *hostname* arguments, something like

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\putty.exe" -ssh -pw s3cr3t user@server01.example.com
```

Voil√†! Now you can connect just clicking on the shortcut. Even better:

* rename your shortcut as `user@hostname` argument, for instance *user@server01.example.com*
* on Windows 8, right click the shortcut and *Pin to Start*

Now you can access **really quickly** to your connection: <kbd>HOST + user@serv ...</kbd>

### Export from regedit

I admit I try to export configuration from *regedit* one year after I wrote this article, and I couldn't do it at first attempt, so it is better I annotate this trick for the future *me*.

Right click on the *regedit* entry and export, choose the *.reg* format. Then open the file with *vim* and remove the null characters by typing `:% s/`<kbd>CTRL</kbd>`2//g`.
