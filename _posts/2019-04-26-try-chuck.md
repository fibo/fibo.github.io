./configure
sudo make
sudo make install
```

Before building ChucK from sources, install the following requirements

```
sudo apt-get install bison flex libasound2-dev
```

Then do something like the following

```bash
tar xf chuck-1.4.0.0.tgz
cd chuck-1.4.0.0/src
sudo make linux-alsa
sudo make install
```
