## We are people, not machines

Probably you know, almost every website has a [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/robotstxt.html) so why not have a *humans.txt*?

What a nice idea! [Humanstxt](http://humanstxt.org/) is a nice initiative for
knowing people behind a website.

It is just a *txt* file, so if you have a website, **just use it!** to tell the world wide web who you are

... ah, and you can also [record you in the list of Humans](http://humanstxt.org/Im-human.html)!

By the way, here it is [my humans.txt](http://g14n.info/humans.txt).
