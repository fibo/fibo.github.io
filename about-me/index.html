  <h3>GitHub</h3>
  <p>Talking of my addictions, I joined GitHub (thanks to the mythic <a href="http://ingy.net">Ingy döt Net</a>), and I put there almost all the code I write, including this site which is also hosted on GitHub Pages. I am convinced that GitHub behaviour and ethic is the key for the evolution of mankind in this new millenium. <a href="https://github.com/thank-you-github/thank-you-github/pull/419">Thank you GitHub!</a></p>

  <p>My nick on GitHub is <a href="https://github.com/fibo" title="GitHub" rel="me">fibo</a> that stands for Leonardo Pisano (a.k.a. Fibonacci, the son of Bonacci), which was the main mathematician of the middle age. I have <img src="/svg/github/followers/fibo.svg" alt="GitHub followers"></p>

  <h3>vvvv</h3>
  <p>Fibonacci is famous for its sequence, but, he didn't really care about it: it was just one of the many excercises in its book <em>Liber Abaci</em>. There are many math formulas waiting to be discovered or rediscovered, think about Euler for example: most of the works written by the most prolific mathematician are still unpublished, just waiting. I really enjoy keep studying mathematics and implement it with a programming language, for example I produced a vvvv contribution that let artists play with Chaos Theory formulas: it is called <a href="http://vvvv.org/contribution/chaostoys">Chaos Toys</a>. I really like vvvv as an environment to play with mathematics, and it is very exciting for me thinking about artists that experiment with math formulas I implemented with vvvv. It is a fun way of doing math research, to free the formulas from the books and release them in some artistic installation that can push forward its conception to a level that even the original author could not imagine. This is my <a href="http://vvvv.org/users/fibo" title="VVVV" rel="me">vvvv profile page</a>. I am glad that vvvv users call me <em>fibo</em> on line and on site.</p>

  <h3>Linkedin</h3>
<p>This is my <a href="https://it.linkedin.com/in/gianlucacasati" title="Linkedin" rel="me">Linkedin profile</a>, and I would like to share also a nice story about Linkedin. As an experiment, I created the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/grp/home?gid=4743207">vvvv users group</a> hoping it can help hiring vvvv developers. The group was created just after node13 event, on November 2013 and at the time of this writing has more than 200 users.</p>
