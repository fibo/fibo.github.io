### Style

Yes! [Jekyll] supports [Sass], I am using a [style.scss](https://github.com/fibo/fibo.github.io/blob/master/style.scss) that imports partials from the [_sass/ folder](https://github.com/fibo/fibo.github.io/tree/master/_sass) and it is integrated on [GitHub Pages].
See [templates/page](https://fibo.github.io/templates/page) for a showcase of styles used.

### Images

When editing post *2000-01-01-post-slug.md*, create a folder *images/2000/01/post-slug*
which contains all images relative to that post, then you can reference them with

```markdown
![image decription](/images{{ page.id }}/image_name.jpg)
```

If you want the image to be responsive add the `responsive` CSS class

```markdown
![image decription](http://image/url){:.responsive}
```

### Link to post

Use the snippet `[linked text]{% post_url yyyy-mm-dd-foo-bar %}`, for example

```
See how to install [AWS Redshift compatible PostgreSQL client]{% post_url 2016-05-12-aws-redshift-compatible-psql %} article.
```

### Post tags

Every tag can have a [tag](./tag) subfolder named as `{ tag | slugify }`.
To show it as a link in tag badges, edit `_data/tagpage.yml`; for example
if there is only one post tagged with that keywork it does not make sense to list all of its related posts in a page.
Furthermore, tag could by a typo or tag folder could not exist yet.

### Tips & Tricks

#### Escape Liquid tags

To escape Liquid tags, use `{{ "{% this " }}%}`. To escape `{{ this }}`, use `{{ "{{ this " }}}}`.
