# three-orbitcontrols

> is the [three.js] OrbitControls from official repo examples

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/three-orbitcontrols.png)](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/three-orbitcontrols/)

All credit goes to [OrbitControls.js][original_orbitcontrols] contributors.
I have just **stolen** the code and modified to export it as a module
so you can do something like

```javascript
var THREE = require('three')
var OrbitControls = require('three-orbitcontrols')

// Init THREE scene (add your code)

var camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, width / height, 0.1, 1000)
camera.position.z = 5

var renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ canvas })

var controls = new OrbitControls(camera, renderer.domElement)
controls.enableDamping = true
controls.dampingFactor = 0.25
controls.enableZoom = false
```

Please note that:

1. You call `OrbitControls` directly instead of `THREE.OrbitControls`
2. This package does not depend directly on [three.js], which is declared as a peer dependency, so to install you will do

```bash
npm install three three-orbitcontrols --save
```

There is another package similar to this one: [three-orbit-controls].
I decided to create another package with a different approach, see [this issue for the rationale](https://github.com/mattdesl/three-orbit-controls/issues/17).

I am using this package for my [3d tic tac toe](http://play.tris3d.net) online game.

License is the same as [three.js], i.e. [MIT].
