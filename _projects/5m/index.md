## Installation

```bash
npm i 5m
```

## Test

*NOTA BENE* tests will require at least five minutes to run.

```bash
npm t
```

## Annotated source

Store data in a namespaced buffer, as well as its function to flush data.

    var buffer = {}
    var flush = {}

Store last time data was write and when is current time for a given namespace.

    var lastWrite = {}
    var now = {}

Considering 1 char should be 1 byte, and dates are expressed in milliseconds, the following constants
express *5 MB* and *5 minutes* where aproximation is ok, since we want to achieve a near real time.

    const fiveMb = 1024 * 1024 * 5
    const fiveMin = 300 * 1000

Make sure no data is lost on exit.

    process.on('exit', () => {
      for (namespace in buffer) flush[namespace]()
    })

Create the **5m** function with the following signature

* **@param** `{String}` namespace
* **@param** `{Function}` write
* **@returns** `{Function}` logger

Since *5m* is allowed as npm package name, but not as JavaScript identifier,
using a roman number like *Vm* can be confusing, so maybe naming the function
as *fiveM* is a good idea.

    function fiveM (namespace, write) {

Initialize *buffer* and *lastWrite*.

      buffer[namespace] = ''
      lastWrite[namespace] = new Date()

Create the namespaced *flush* function: write data and clean up.

      flush[namespace] = () => {
          write(buffer[namespace])

          delete buffer[namespace]
          lastWrite[namespace] = new Date()
      }

Create the **logger** function with the following signature

* **@param** `{*}` data

      return function logger (data) {

Set write time for current namespace.

        now[namespace] = new Date()

Append data to named buffer.

        buffer[namespace] += data

Check if there is some data and it is bigger than *5 MB* or it is older than *5 minutes*.

        const thereIsSomeData = buffer[namespace].length > 0
        const exceededSpace = (buffer[namespace].length > fiveMb)
        const exceededTime = (fiveMin < now[namespace] - lastWrite[namespace])

If yes, flush it!

        if (thereIsSomeData && (exceededSpace || exceededTime)) {
          flush[namespace]()
        }

Export it.

      }
    }

    module.exports = fiveM
