> wake up bears 🐻 ride bulls 🐂

[graphql-ccxt GraphQL schema source here](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt/blob/main/src/graphql/schema.graphql)

## Features

- Joins together [GraphQL] and [CCXT]: can fetch prices, read balance, open orders, etc. on multiple exchanges at once.
- No dependencies other than [graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql) and [ccxt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ccxt) (by the way, installed as peer deps).
- It's isomorphic! It works on a server as usual (see demo below), but also in a browser (see [examples/browser/](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt/tree/main/examples/browser) folder).

## Credits

Tons of kudos to creators of [GraphQL] and [CCXT]. Coders that designed and implemented both projects are so smart and passionate, they are a great example of the power of _open source_.

## Installation

Install this package and add the following _peer dependencies_:

- graphql
- ccxt

For instance with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) launch

```bash
npm install graphql ccxt graphql-ccxt
```

## Demo

0. Get [this repository](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt) code.
1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Launch the demo: `npm start`

Then point your browser to http://localhost:4000/graphql

Take a look to [examples/graphql/](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt/tree/main/examples/graphql) folder.
It contains both queries and mutations, among others:

- [fetch Bitcoin price](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt/blob/main/examples/graphql/ticker_01.graphql)
- [fetch multiple prices, Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt/blob/main/examples/graphql/tickers_01.graphql)
- [fetch your balance](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt/blob/main/examples/graphql/balance_01.graphql)
- [fetch your balance, only Bitcoin and Ethereum](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt/blob/main/examples/graphql/balance_02.graphql)
- [create an order](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt/blob/main/examples/graphql/createOrder_01.graphql)
- [create orders on multiple exchanges](https://github.com/fibo/graphql-ccxt/blob/main/examples/graphql/createOrderMulti_01.graphql)

### Access private API

**Optionally**, before launching the _demo server_, set the following environment variables accordingly:

- `BINANCE_APIKEY`
- `BINANCE_APISECRET`

### Demo source code

The demo server is implemented by the following code.

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql')
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql')
const {
  GraphqlCcxtContext,
  graphqlCcxtRoot,
  graphqlCcxtSchemaSource
} = require('graphql-ccxt')

async function startDemo() {
  // 1. Create GraphQL context. It holds your exchange clients.
  ////
  const context = new GraphqlCcxtContext()
  // Add a public client on Coinbase exchange.
  await context.addClient({
    exchange: 'coinbase'
  })
  // Add another client on Binance exchange.
  // It will be private if environment variables are defined, otherwise it will be public.
  await context.addClient({
    exchange: 'binance',
    apiKey: process.env.BINANCE_APIKEY,
    secret: process.env.BINANCE_APISECRET
  })

  // 2. Build GraphQL schema.
  ////
  const schema = buildSchema(graphqlCcxtSchemaSource)

  // 3. Launch express-graphql server.
  ////
  express()
    .use(
      '/graphql',
      graphqlHTTP({
        schema,
        rootValue: graphqlCcxtRoot,
        context,
        graphiql: {
          defaultQuery: '{ clients { exchange } }'
        }
      })
    )
    .listen(4000, () => {
      console.log(
        'Running a graphql-ccxt server at http://localhost:4000/graphql'
      )
    })
}

startDemo()
```
