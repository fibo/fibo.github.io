## Usage

> [EditorConfig] helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

Launching the command

```bash
npm install dot-editorconfig --save-dev
```

will create, in your package dir, an *.editorconfig* file with [this content](#source).
You can optionally gitignore it or version it and modify it.
Please note that **dot-editorconfig will not override your .editorconfig**
so if you need to upgrade it is necessary to do an `rm .editorconfig`.
It is up to you to choose to gitignore or version and modify further your
*.editorconfig* according to your needs.

## Contributing

If you also like the idea to have an easy to install and share *.editorconfig*
and you think you can contribute adding something missing or improving current
configuration, edit this [README] in the **Source section** and send a
pull request.
Do not edit the *.editorconfig* file, since it is generated with `make`.
